# The Task Construct in OpenMP

OpenMP internally packs the code and data into chunks, referred to as tasks, when it encounters an 'omp parallel' directive. It then assigns these tasks to the threads in the team based on the scheduling policy.

The 'task' construct allows the decoupling of the packing and execution of tasks. After the 'omp parallel' directive, each thread that is spawned creates a task from the structured block defined after the 'task' construct.  This allows for the dynamic creation and later execution of the task

A thread executes the created task immediately or defers its execution to a different thread in the team.

The 'single' directive can be used after the 'parallel' directive to ensure that the execution occurs on only one thread within the team.

The 'taskwait' directive is used to specify a wait for the completion of child tasks generated by the current task.

The 'task' construct can be useful for parallelizing recursive algorithms.
